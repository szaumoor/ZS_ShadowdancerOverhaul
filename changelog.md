# Changelog

## Fixes

- Due to an engine limitation, Hide in Plain Sight can show the message "failed to hide in the shadows" when casting the ability while the game is paused, even if you succeeded. The message is now removed, and only visual feedback remains (i.e. your character won't be invisible).
- Implemented a stronger solution to prevent engine quirks when casting Hide in Plain Sight when casting and pausing at an unfortunate time
