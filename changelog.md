# Changelog

## Fixes

- Many readme and description improvements, typos fixed

## Modifications

- Rewrite of many descriptions to various degrees
- Renamed Artisan of Shadows to Shadow Artisan
- Renamed Shadowchill Strike to Chilling Strike
- Renamed Elusive Mind to Slippery Mind, as compatibility with ToF is no longer a concern I have at the moment.
- Shadow Swap, the ability from your shade, now starts off with a cooldown of 2 turns, instead of 5, and the cooldown is reduced by 4 rounds with each Shade tier, down to 4 rounds when Nighthaunt tier is reached.
- Compatibility with Pits of Despair (ongoing) added. Nephetel is updated to use my kit instead of the vanilla shadowdancer.
