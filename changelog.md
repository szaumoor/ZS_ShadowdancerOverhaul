# Changelog

## Fixes

- Improved code quality and other misc fixes.
- Fixed description inaccuracy in the setup.tra file regarding Shadow Shield

## Modifications

- Added Shadow Dance to replace Evasion and Improved Evasion HLAs. Functions as a mix of RR's version of Evasion and the original, which also provides a half a round invisibility effect every round for 5 rounds to confuse enemies, and sneak a backstab in if you're lucky.
- Includes now the splprot script to add all the entries required in all my mods
- Added configuration file. Currently, it only works to enable or disable the RR HLAs replacement. As of this version, only Alchemy vanilla is replaced by RR's version of Alchemy.
- Artisan of Shadows no longer infuses backstabs with shadow magic. That has been outsourced to a new HLA, Shadow Strike, which allows the shadowdancer to infuse their backstabs with different effects for 1 turn. This new HLA replaces Scribe Scrolls.
- Removed the item tweaks for shadowdancer part of the mod, I don't like it anymore, and in any event, that sort of thing will belong in my tweak mod if it must be somewhere.
- Removed Alchemy from HLA, and with that all RR compatibility stuff, since it's no longer needed
