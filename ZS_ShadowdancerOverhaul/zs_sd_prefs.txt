// Controls how much damage resistance is gained with each rank (there are 3 ranks). You may change this if you think it's too much or too little, like for setups with conservative sources of DR. Valid values are 1 to 10 (3-30% DR at most). Default is 5% per rank, resulting in a total 15% damage reduction
