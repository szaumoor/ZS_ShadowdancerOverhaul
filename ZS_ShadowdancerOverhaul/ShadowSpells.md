## Fade
Description:
The shade instantly becomes invisible for 24 hours.

Notes: This works identically as Invisibility as per the mage spell. The Shadow regenerates faster while invisible (by any means). It starts with 3 castings of this, up to 8 times per day.

## Improved Fade
The shade becomes invisible as per the Improved Invisibility spell for 2 turns.

Notes: this acts exactly as Improved Invisibility, as per the wizard spell, except the duration is set. One use is gained at Shadowdancer level 16, which will grow to 2 uses per day at higher levels.

## Drain Life
The shade drains the life of the victim for 4 + 1d4 magic damage, which is transferred to the shade for 1 turn as healing or extra maximum health.

Notes: This works exactly as a modified version of Larloch's Minor Drain, which I stole from ToF's tweak to this spell, without an ounce of shame. It will get 1 castings of this spell when the Shadowdancer is level 5, up to 8 times per day at max level.

## Vampiric Touch
Description:
The shade drains health from the victim as per the Vampiric Touch spell.

Notes: Behaves exactly as the wizard spell. Only one use per day, gained at Shadowdancer level 12.

## Teleport without error
Description:
Teleport to any point within the field of vision instantly and become invisible for 1 round.

Notes: this becomes an at-will spell after the Shadowdancer becomes level 28. Otherwise, it keeps getting further castings per day. Three uses are gained at level 12, when the Shadow becomes a Greater Shadow, which grow up to 6 castings, before it becomes an at-will ability.

## Beshadowed Self
Description:
The shade temporarily imbues their own body with Shadow magic, making it more difficult to damage it, gaining temporary +4 AC and will resist 50% more physical and fire damage resistance for 10 seconds. During this time, it will be under Improved Invisibility, and it will also regenerates faster during this time, recovering 1 hitpoint per second. Additionally, after level 16, this ability will protect the shade against the first physical damage directed at it. This ability may be cast once per 20 rounds, which improves to 15 rounds at level 15, 13 rounds at level 19, and 10 rounds at level 24.

Notes:
1) the improved physical protection is multiplicative. For example, if your shadow is level 3, and therefore resists 30% of physical non-missile damage, and 40% of missile damage, activating this ability will improve the resistance to 45% non-missile damage and 60% missile damage. At max level, activating this would yield 75% physical non-missile damage resistance, and 90% missile damage resistance.
2) The fire resistance bonus, which is added if you need a brief boost against fire, which is the one element the shadow is weak against, is instead additive, improving it by +50%.
3) The regeneration is independent of the Shadow's regeneration when invisible ability, and its natural regeneration, so they all stack. When the Shadow becomes naturally hasted this, and all sources of regeneration will double in speed due to how the haste opcode works. This is still in no way overpowered and not even close to troll or werewolf regeneration, but very very useful to keep the summon going through any dungeon crawl adventure. It's recommended to keep the shadow invisible in the down time using any of their abilities (or abilities of any other party member or ally).
4) Because the ability is quite powerful, it can only be cast after a long cooldown, which improves to once per turn at higher levels.
5) After level 16, it will additionally act effectively as a 1-layer stoneskin, which blocks the first successful physical attack against the shade.
6) This ability is available from the very beginning. Only one casting, since it works on cooldowns.

## Darkness
Description:
The shade causes total, impenetrable darkness. Neither normal nor magical light works in the area of effect. All vision (including infravision) is severely limited; anyone hostile caught in the area of effect is for all practical purposes blinded as per the 1st-level wizard spell. Creatures that leave the area covered by darkness will have their vision restored after 1 round.

Notes: This acts the same as Darkness as it's found in Siege of the Dragonspear. Available since Shadowdancer level 8. Only one use per day.

## Dispel Magic
Description:
The shade attempts to dispel all magic as per the wizard or cleric Dispel Magic spell.~

Notes: this uses the creature's innate casting level, which grows up to level 27, which should make it useful for quite a while. Gained at Shadowdancer level 12, when the shadow becomes a Greater Shadow; one casting per day.

## Doom the Living
Description:
The nigthaunt points its finger to a living target sending a ray of dark energy. The victim dies unless it succeeds a Save vs. Death at -2. If succeeded, the spell will still inflict 1d10+4 magic damage and affect the target with the effects of the Doom spell for 1 turn, which cannot be resisted.

Notes: This ability is specific of the Nighthaunt version of the shade, which happens at Shadowdancer level 36 and can be cast once per day. It's essentially a more particular Finger of Death spell which uses Save vs. Death saves and causes the target to be affected by Doom, if resisted. Because of this, it's more likely to be lethal towards classes with weak constitutions, such as wizards, sorcerers, rogues, and bards (the opposite is true for Finger of Death).

## See Invisibility
Description:
The shade becomes briefly able to see invisible creatures, revealing them right after, unless protected against divination attacks. The shade can cast this spell once per 3 rounds.

Notes: This acts exactly as the wizard spell of Detect Invisibility. It's gained at Shadowdancer level 20, when the Shadow becomes a Shadowlord.
