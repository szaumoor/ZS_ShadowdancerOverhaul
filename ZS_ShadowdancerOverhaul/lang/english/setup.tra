@0 = ~SHADOWDANCER: Shadowdancers move with effortless grace along the threshold of light and darkness, innately able to weave the magic of shadows and illusions. They embody a diverse array of adventurers who recognize that shadow is a force to be shaped, not feared. Whether motivated by curiosity, ambition, or necessity, shadowdancers are renowned for their incredible stealth, agility, and the ability to strike swiftly from the shadows. Their talents make them invaluable as scouts and spies, capable of infiltrating and gathering information with skill that other Thieves cannot match. Despite their affinity with darkness, it does not align them necessarily with evil. To a shadowdancer, darkness is merely a tool, devoid of the moral judgments typically imposed by others.

Advantages:
– Infravision, even if not normally available to the selected race
– Immunity to magical Darkness spells
– Stealthy: +20 points to Hide in the Shadows and Move Silently at level 1, improved by +5 at every third level thereafter.
– Natural Evasion: +2 bonus to Armor Class (+4 vs. missile), movement speed, and saves vs. Breath.
– Slippery Mind: The shadowdancer gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against Spells, Wands, and all Enchantment and Illusion effects. This bonus increases by +1 at level 12 and every 12 levels after.
– Hide in Plain Sight: <PRO_HESHE> can become hidden, even while observed, for 20 seconds once per turn. The cooldown is reduced by 1 round at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, to a minimum of 2 rounds. The chance of success depends on <PRO_HISHER> Hide in Shadows skill, but this ability is separate from the standard thief hiding skill—it functions as a unique, innate power.
– May cast Shadowstep (Planeshift / Blink) once per day. A new use is gained every two levels thereafter.

SHADOWSTEP (Planeshift): Step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, moving faster, effectively resisting and dodging every attack, and becoming completely undetectable for the duration while time stands still for the rest. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> cannot damage others, be targeted by others, or cast spells, but <PRO_HESHE> may move at will during this time. Upon returning to the Prime, <PRO_HESHE> gains temporary bonuses to <PRO_HISHER> combat effectiveness, including the ability to backstab from any angle. These benefits scale with the shadowdancer's level.

SHADOWSTEP (Blink): An alternative to the planeshift version, the shadowdancer may choose instead to instantly teleport to a place within sight, which applies all the benefits of the planeshift version.

– May cast Shadow Leap once every three rounds. This is a lesser version of Shadowstep that allows the shadowdancer to teleport a short distance while granting subtle defensive and offensive bonuses for one round, and unlike Shadowstep, can be interrupted.
– May cast Shadow Illusion once per day, gaining one use at level 3, 12, and 20.

SHADOW ILLUSION: Conjure shadowy illusions to confuse enemies. Unless a save vs. Spell is made, it causes one of the following: fear, berserk, blindness, or confusion for 1 round. For the next four rounds, enemies have a chance to resist these effects each round, but may still fall prey to them. During the full 5 rounds, affected enemies also lose immunity to backstabs, if they had it, and suffer a 25% spell failure. The spell improves with level but has no effect on creatures with very high intelligence, or those that innately see through illusions. It is not subject to Magic Resistance or dispelling effects but True Sight can remove it or prevent its effects from taking hold.

– May cast Summon Shade once per day, gaining a single use at level 4.

SUMMON SHADE: Summon a shade from the Plane of Shadow for 8 hours. It is loyal to the caster, resistant to damage, and immune to turning and spells that banish summoned creatures. Its touch can temporarily drain Strength from its victims if a save vs. Death at +2 is failed. As the shadowdancer gains experience, the shade does as well, becoming more capable, and evolving into greater shades.

– May cast Shadow Evade once per day, gaining one use at level 5, and then again at levels 10 and 15.

SHADOW EVADE: The shadowdancer conceals <PRO_HIMHER>self in shadowstuff for 5 rounds, making <PRO_HIMHER> harder to hit. It provides a +4 bonus to Armor Class, a +2 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 15% universal damage resistance. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> is also under the effects of Invisibility. Each new use adds 5% to its damage resistance.

– May cast Shadow Conjuration once per day starting at level 6, with additional uses gained at levels 9 and 12.

SHADOW CONJURATION: This skill allows the shadowdancer to draw various amounts of energy from the Demiplane of Shadow to conjure phantasmal version of one of the following spells: Darkness, Invisibility, Shield, Magic Missile, Sleep. The spells are always cast at half the shadowdancer's current level.

– Shadow Haven: At level 10, shadows embrace <PRO_HIMHER> while invisible, regenerating 1 Hit Point per round, while protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from detection by all means except True Sight.
– Greater Shadow Conjuration: At level 12, <PRO_HESHE> learns a more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Melf's Acid Arrow, Web, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Blindness. New uses are gained at levels 15 and 18.
– Shades: At level 18, <PRO_HESHE> learns an even more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Cone of Cold, Shadow Fireball, Stoneskin, Shadow Door. New uses are gained at levels 21 and 24.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to any non-lawful
– Backstab multiplier uses the normal progression, but it only grows up to 4x
– May only distribute 15 skill points per level (40 at level 1) among thieving skills
– May not use the Set Snare ability or learn any High-Level Abilities that introduce traps
– May not have access to the Alchemy and Scribe Scrolls High-Level Abilities

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma~

@1 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you've spent your childhood yearning for a life cloaked in shadows and secrecy. While other children played at knights and dragons, you danced unseen through the quiet halls of Candlekeep, imagining yourself a phantom among the blind and complacent. The ambling, preoccupied monks have often played the role of secret lords of Waterdeep in your mind, their purses tempting tests of your growing skill. Gorion, ever perceptive, has more than once asked you to discreetly return an inkwell or scroll to its rightful place, though rarely with more than a knowing glance. Though the deeper vaults of the keep remain beyond your reach, you've found little satisfaction in pilfering from your caretakers. Instead, your heart yearns for a grander stage—one where your steps vanish in silence and your talents can truly flourish in the dark.~

@2 = ~"Where there is much light, the shadow is deep." You never thought of that as wisdom—just a useful fact. Under cover of night, bright streets create blind spots, and people watching the light rarely notice what moves between them. You learned how to cross open ground by choosing the right moment, how to vanish without a trace, and how to step from one pool of darkness into another so quickly that witnesses swear you were never in between. That talent drew the wrong kind of attention the night a job ended with too many unanswered questions and no clear explanation.

The city watch dislikes mysteries, and the clergy dislikes anything that resembles blasphemy or dark arts. Guild leaders, for their part, dislike anyone whose methods they don't understand. None of them can prove what you've done, but enough unjustified and superstitious rumors have piled up to make your name uncomfortable to say out loud. In your trade, being very hard to catch is useful—being in the limelight is not.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the familiar rooftops and lamplit streets of your home and turned north. Perhaps in a few years the stories will fade into obscurity and be dismissed as baseless folklore. Until then, frontier towns offer darker nights, looser scrutiny, and more room to work—and fewer witnesses interested in filling in the gaps.~

// SHADOWDANCER SPELLS

@300 = ~Planeshift~
@301 = ~Blink~
@3 = ~Shadowstep~
@4 = ~Shadowstep
This spell can be cast in two ways: Planeshift or Blink. The shadowdancer chooses which version to use at the moment of the casting.

Planeshift: Instantly step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, increasing movement speed by a factor of 2 (with each additional use further increasing speed by a factor of 1). While in the Shadow Plane, the shadowdancer is completely undetectable, immune to all effects that allow a saving throw, and time stands still for others. During this period, <PRO_HESHE> cannot attack, be attacked, or cast spells, but can move freely for tactical positioning.

Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the shadowdancer gains the following benefits for roughly half a round:

– May backstab from any direction once
– Attacks cannot critically miss and ignore weapon speed factor delays
– Luck: +1
– THAC0: +1, increasing by +1 every three levels (up to +6)
– Damage: +1, increasing by +1 every six levels (up to +3)
– Critical hit chances: +5%, improving to +10% at level 13 and +15% at level 25

These benefits are consumed after the first successful attack (a hit that is not blocked by weapon immunities) following shadowstep. For the remainder of the effect's duration, the shadowdancer retains a +6 bonus to saving throws and Armor Class.

Blink: Alternatively, the shadowdancer may instantly teleport to any visible location. This version grants all the same benefits as Planeshift, which apply immediately after teleporting.

This spell does not break the user out of invisibility.~

@5 = ~Shadow Illusion~
@6 = ~Shadow Illusion
Conjure shadowy illusions that disorient an enemy. Unless a save vs. Spell is made, this ability causes one of the following effects: fear, berserk, blindness, or confusion for 1 round. For the next four rounds, the enemy has a chance to resist these effects each round, but may still succumb to them. During the full 5 rounds, the enemy has a 25% spell failure penalty, and it also loses immunity to sneak attacks and backstabs, if they had it. The spell improves at higher levels as follows:

– Save penalty improves by 1 at level 8, and every 6 levels thereafter, up to -4.
– At level 12, the spell affects nearby enemies, causing chaos among them.
– At level 14, the targets become more susceptible to damage, taking 10% more physical damage and suffering a -4 penalty to Armor Class.
– At level 17, blindness is always applied if the spell is successful, along with any other effects. This blindness cannot be resisted in subsequent rounds.

This spell has no effect on creatures with very high intelligence (18 or more), or those that can see through illusions, such as demons and dragons. It is not subject to Magic Resistance or dispelling effects although True Sight can remove it or prevent their effects from taking hold on their caster.~

@7 = ~Summon Shade~
@8 = ~Summon Shade
Summon an invisible, neutrally aligned shade from the Plane of Shadow for 8 hours or until it is slain. This shadowy creature possesses all the immunities of an undead being, including immunity to turning, to spells that destroy or banish summoned creatures, to blindness, and to illithid attacks. It is highly resistant to damage, regenerates slowly (faster when invisible), and can temporarily drain Strength from its victims with a touch, if they fail a save vs. Death at +2.

This loyal undead companion starts off less powerful than its regular counterparts, but grows stronger as the shadowdancer gains experience. It evolves into more capable and resistant forms, gaining innate abilities and ultimately transforming into greater types of shades:

– Shadow from levels 4 to 11
– Greater Shadow from levels 12 to 19
– Shadowlord from levels 20 to 27
– Greater Shadowlord from levels 28 to 35
– Nighthaunt at level 36 and above

The creature's Hit Dice (HD) are always one fewer than the shadowdancer's, up to a maximum of 27 HD.~

@9 = ~Hide in plain sight~
@90 = ~Failed to hide in plain sight~
@10 = ~Hide in plain sight
Immediately hide, even in plain sight, for 20 seconds once per turn. The cooldown decreases by 1 round at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, reaching a minimum of 2 rounds at level 40.

The chances of success are directly tied to the shadowdancer's Hiding in Shadows ability in the following way:

– 0-30: 50% chance of success
– 31-50: 65% chance of success
– 51-75: 80% chance of success
– 76-100: 90% chance of success
– 101-150: 95% chance of success
– 151-200: 99% chance of success
– 201+: 100% chance of success

Note that the success chance is also affected by any penalties or bonuses to the shadowdancer's Hiding in Shadows ability, such as through magical effects or gear. For example, if the shadowdancer has exactly 70 points in the ability, they would have 80% chance of success, but if they had magical boots that granted 40 point bonus to the ability, they would have 95% chance of success.~

@10010 = ~Hide in plain sight is available for use.~

@11 = ~Shadow Form
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/10 levels starting at level 30
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: The caster

This ability is a more powerful version of Shadow Evade that temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-stuff, making the subject partially incorporeal and regenerating 1 Hit Point per second. For its duration, gain a +4 Armor Class bonus, and all attacks directed against the shadowdancer deal 50% less of their normal damage. Additionally, the user is under the effects of Improved Invisibility, receives a +4 bonus to all Saving Throws, and may not be detected by any divinations until they choose to partially reveal themselves by taking certain actions, or the effect runs out. This, however, will not prevent creatures that naturally see through invisibility from detecting the shadowdancer.

Requirements: Improved Shadow Evade~

@12 = ~Shadow Maze
This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 7 feet of the shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or become trapped inside that space between 5 to 14 rounds. This spell becomes increasingly difficult to resist as the shadowdancer becomes more experienced: at level 28, the penalty becomes -5, and at 36, -6.

After being released, living beings resurface feeling weakened for 1 turn, suffering the following non-stackable effects:

– Strength, Dexterity, Armor Class, THAC0, damage, saving throws, and casting speed: -2 penalty
– Movement speed reduced by 25%
– 5% increased chance to critically miss when attacking

These penalties cannot reduce Strength or Dexterity below 1.~

@13 = ~Shadow Weaver~
@14 = ~Shadow Weaver
Your mastery over the elusive power of shadows has now reached incredible heights. As a testament to your profound connection with it, you gain the following abilities:

– Immunity to blindness
– Casting, movement, and weapon speed factor are permanently increased by 2
– Backstabs no longer require you to be behind the target to be successful
– For two rounds after landing a critical hit, the target loses their immunity to backstabs, if they had it, and the shadowdancer gains a 5% bonus to critical hit chances and cannot critically miss (does not stack)

Requirements: Shadowdancer only~

@130 = ~Shadowstrike~
@131 = ~Shadowstrike
The shadowdancer may choose to infuse their backstabs with a bit of shadow magic for 1 turn to achieve various effects:

– Beshadowed Strike: Backstabs have a 30% chance of making the shadowdancer immediately invisible for 2 rounds, and the target is blinded for 3 rounds unless a save vs. Spell at -4 is made.
– Chilling Strike: Backstabs deal extra 1d4 cold and 1d4 magic damage. If the target is blinded, they deal 2d4+1 cold and 2d4+1 magic damage.
– Enervating Strike: Backstabs halve the victim's Strength for 5 rounds if they fail a save vs. Death (does not stack, and cannot reduce Strength below 1). Attacks will also deal maximum damage during the first round.

During this time, the critical hit chances are +5% greater, and if the target is immune to backstabs, the shadowdancer's hits have a 10% chance of removing their immunity for 10 seconds (this may not happen more than once every 5 rounds). None of these effects are affected by Magic Resistance and they do not stack with each other. Each application replaces the other.~

@132 = ~Beshadowed Strike~
@133 = ~Chilling Strike~
@134 = ~Enervating Strike~

@15 = ~Self-Concealment~
@16 = ~Self-Concealment

@2102 = ~Greater Shadow Conjuration~
@2103 = ~Greater Shadow Conjuration
This skill allow the shadowdancer to draw substantial energy from the Demiplane of Shadow to conjure a shadowy version of a selection of arcane spells. The following spells are available: Melf's Acid Arrow, Web, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Blindness.

All spells are always cast at half the shadowdancer's current level. For example, to cast Shadow Door at level 10, the shadowdancer must attain first level 20.~

The user also becomes immune to necromancy spells and gains 20 points of skill in Hide in Shadows and Move Silently. This spell can be dispelled with Dispel Magic, as well as True Sight.

– +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows and Move Silently
– Surrounded by 8 images, as per the Mirror Image spell

This protection can be removed by Dispel Magic or by spells that dispel illusions, such as True Sight.~

@2120 = ~Shadow Dance~
@2121 = ~Shadow Dance
For five rounds, shadowdancers of exceptional skill can perform an agile and disorienting shadow-dance that allows them to automatically avoid the effects of spells and special abilities that can be evaded, such as dragon breath, fireballs, lightning bolts, skull traps, explosive potions, wands of fire, dangerous waves of water, and many others, through a combination of superior reflexes, extraordinary agility and a bit of their innate shadow magic.

During this time, the shadowdancer becomes briefly invisible for 3 seconds once per round, disorienting and disrupting the targeting of the enemies around them. This ability also improves Armor Class by 6 and Saving Throws by 3. In addition, it allows the shadowdancer to move so quickly that <PRO_HISHER> movement rate is increased by 4 (base is 9) and missiles have no chance of striking <PRO_HIMHER>.

This ability cannot be dispelled or Breached, although the invisibility effect can be disrupted by True Sight and other invisibility dispelling effects.~
@2122 = ~Shadow Dance: Evaded effect~

@23 = ~Backstab immunity removed~
@24 = ~Backstab immunity removal effect wore off~

@25 = ~Shadow Evade~
@26 = ~Shadow Evade
For 5 rounds, the shadowdancer cloaks <PRO_HIMHER>self in shadows, making <PRO_HIMHER> harder to hit. This grants a +4 bonus to Armor Class, +2 to all Saving Throws, and 15% damage resistance. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> is also under the effects of Invisibility. Each additional use of this ability increases damage resistance by 5% (up to a maximum of 25%). This effect also provides immunity to Shadow Fireball and Delayed Blast Shadow Fireball spells accessed through Shadow Conjurations.~

@27 = ~Improved Shadow Evade~
@28 = ~Improved Shadow Evade
The shadowdancer's Shadow Evade ability is upgraded permanently to Shadow Form. In this new form, damage resistance increases to 50%, the invisibility becomes Improved, the shadowdancer regenerates 1 Hit Point per second, and becomes immune to all divination spells during the 5 rounds it lasts.~

@50 = ~Weakened by Shadow Maze~

@60 = ~Shadow Twin
This ability creates an almost exact duplicate of the shadowdancer for 2 turns. The duplicate is created at 60% of the level at which the shadowdancer is currently on. It has all the abilities that the shadowdancer would have at that level. It also has 60% of the Hit Points of the shadowdancer. The duplicate is fully under the control of the shadowdancer. This ability may only used once every 2 turns, and attempts to cast it before this time will fail.~

@70 = ~Shadow Leap~
@71 = ~Shadow Leap
This is a lesser version of Shadowstep that allows the shadowdancer to teleport a short distance. Unlike Shadowstep, it requires concentration to perform it, but it can be cast at will once every three rounds and does not interrupt invisibility. The shadowdancer may use this, for example, to tactically reposition while invisible quickly without spending a Shadowstep use. The following benefits are applied for 1 round:

– THAC0: +1
– Speed Factor: +3
– Armor Class: +1
– All saving throws: +1

Note that after the casting, the shadowdancer requires one second of concentration to complete the teleportation and may not move for that duration.

These benefits do not stack with themselves or with those granted by Shadowstep.~

@7100 = ~Shadow Leap is available for use~

@24998 = ~way of shadow monk~
@24999 = ~Way of Shadow Monk~
@25000 = ~WAY OF SHADOW MONK: Also called shadow monks, shadowdancers, and in some places, ninjas or shinobis, these practitioners weave shadow and illusion to conceal, mislead, and strike unseen. Unbound by strict orders or dogma, they regard darkness as a neutral instrument rather than a mark of evil, shaping it with discipline and subtlety to confound foes and slip beyond ordinary sight.

Advantages:
– Infravision
– Stealthy: +20 points to Hide in the Shadows and Move Silently at level 1, improved by +5 at every third level thereafter.
– May invest points into the Detect Illusion skill, starting with a +10 point bonus.
– Slippery Mind: +2 bonus to saving throws vs. Enchantment and Illusion effects.
– May backstab with a 2x multiplier from any angle.
– Hide in Plain Sight: <PRO_HESHE> can become hidden, even while observed, for 20 seconds once per turn. The cooldown is reduced by 1 round at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, to a minimum of 2 rounds. The chance of success depends on <PRO_HISHER> Hide in Shadows skill, but this ability is separate from the standard hiding skill—it functions as a unique, innate power.
– May cast Shadowstep (Planeshift / Blink) once per day. A new use is gained every two levels thereafter.

SHADOWSTEP (Planeshift): Step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, moving faster, effectively resisting and dodging every attack, and becoming completely undetectable for the duration while time stands still for the rest. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> cannot damage others, be targeted by others, or cast spells, but <PRO_HESHE> may move at will during this time. Upon returning to the Prime, <PRO_HESHE> gains temporary bonuses to <PRO_HISHER> combat effectiveness.

SHADOWSTEP (Blink): An alternative to the planeshift version, the shadow monk may choose instead to instantly teleport to a place within sight, which applies all the benefits of the planeshift version.

– May cast Shadow Fist once per day, gaining one use at level 3, and again every 2 levels thereafter.

SHADOW FIST: When this ability is activated, the monk's fists become wreathed in shadowstuff for 3 rounds

– May cast Shadow Evade once per day, gaining one use at level 4, and then again at levels 8 and 12.

SHADOW EVADE: The shadow monk conceals <PRO_HIMHER>self in shadowstuff for 5 rounds, making <PRO_HIMHER> harder to hit. It provides a +4 bonus to Armor Class, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 15% universal damage resistance. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> is also under the effects of Invisibility. Each new use adds 5% to its damage resistance.

– May cast Shadow Conjuration once per day starting at level 6, with additional uses gained at levels 9 and 12.

SHADOW CONJURATION: This skill allows the monk to draw various amounts of energy from the Demiplane of Shadow to conjure phantasmal version of one of the following spells: Darkness, Invisibility, Shield, Magic Missile, Sleep. The spells are always cast at half the monk's current level.

– Shadow Haven: At level 10, shadows embrace <PRO_HIMHER> while invisible, regenerating 1 Hit Point per round, while protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from detection by all means except True Sight.
– Greater Shadow Conjuration: At level 12, <PRO_HESHE> learns a more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Melf's Acid Arrow, Web, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Blindness. New uses are gained at levels 15 and 18.
– Shades: At level 18, <PRO_HESHE> learns an even more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Cone of Cold, Shadow Fireball, Stoneskin, Shadow Door. New uses are gained at levels 21 and 24.

Disadvantages:
– May not use the Lay On Hands ability.
– May not use the Stunning Blow ability.
– Backstab multiplier does not improve beyond 2x
– May not summon a shadow companion, unlike other shadowdancers
– May not have access to the Hardiness or Shadow Twin High-Level Abilities~

@1 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you've spent your childhood yearning for a life cloaked in shadows and secrecy. While other children played at knights and dragons, you danced unseen through the quiet halls of Candlekeep, imagining yourself a phantom among the blind and complacent. The ambling, preoccupied monks have often played the role of secret lords of Waterdeep in your mind, their purses tempting tests of your growing skill. Gorion, ever perceptive, has more than once asked you to discreetly return an inkwell or scroll to its rightful place, though rarely with more than a knowing glance. Though the deeper vaults of the keep remain beyond your reach, you've found little satisfaction in pilfering from your caretakers. Instead, your heart yearns for a grander stage—one where your steps vanish in silence and your talents can truly flourish in the dark.~

@25001 = ~Your youth was shaped by two major influences: your foster father Gorion and a group of monks in service to Mystra who spent several years in Candlekeep. While Gorion worked to grow your intelligence and kindness, the Mystran monks helped you develop the innate abilities to control shadow magic. After the monks departed, you adopted and continued practicing their teachings, and can now rightfully call yourself a monk skilled in the Shadow Ways. While you treasure the years spent in Candlekeep, you feel you must pursue your own destiny in the haven that the shadows provide, to attain spiritual enlightenment.~

@25015 = ~Self-Concealment~
@25016 = ~Self-Concealment
Your essence merges further with the shadows, granting you a permanent +10% resistance to all damage types.

Requirements: Way of Shadow Monk only~

@25003 = ~Shadowstep~
@25004 = ~Shadowstep
This spell can be cast in two ways: Planeshift or Blink. The shadow monk chooses which version to use at the moment of the casting.

Planeshift: Instantly step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, increasing movement speed by a factor of 2. While in the Shadow Plane, the shadow monk is completely undetectable, immune to all effects that allow a saving throw, and time stands still for others. During this period, <PRO_HESHE> cannot attack, be attacked, or cast spells, but can move freely for tactical positioning.

Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the shadow monk gains the following benefits for roughly half a round:

– Damage: +2
– THAC0: +2
– Backstab multiplier: +1
– Critical hit chances: +5%
– Attacks cannot critically miss and ignore weapon speed factor delays

These benefits are consumed after the first successful attack (a hit that is not blocked by weapon immunities) following shadowstep. For the remainder of the effect's duration, the shadow monk retains a +6 bonus to saving throws and Armor Class.

Blink: Alternatively, the shadow monk may instantly teleport to any visible location. This version grants all the same benefits as Planeshift, which apply immediately after teleporting.

This spell does not break the user out of invisibility.~
