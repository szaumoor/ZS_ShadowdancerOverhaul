@0 = ~SHADOWDANCER: Shadowdancers move with effortless grace along the threshold of light and darkness, innately able to weave the magic of shadows and illusions. They embody a diverse array of adventurers who recognize that shadow is a force to be shaped, not feared. Whether motivated by curiosity, ambition, or necessity, shadowdancers are renowned for their incredible stealth, agility, and the ability to strike swiftly from the shadows. Their talents make them invaluable as scouts and spies, capable of infiltrating and gathering information with skill that other Thieves cannot match. Despite their affinity with darkness, it does not align them necessarily with evil. To a shadowdancer, darkness is merely a tool, devoid of the moral judgments typically imposed by others.

Advantages:
– Infravision, even if not normally available to the selected race
– Stealthy: +20 points to Hide in the Shadows and Move Silently at level 1, improved by +5 at every third level thereafter.
– Natural Evasion: +2 bonus to Armor Class (+4 vs. missile), movement speed, and saves vs. Breath.
– Elusive Mind: The shadowdancer gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against Spells, Wands, and all Enchantment and Illusion effects. This bonus increases by +1 at level 12 and every 12 levels after.
– Hide in Plain Sight: <PRO_HESHE> can become hidden, even while observed, for 20 seconds once per turn. The cooldown is reduced by 1 round at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, to a minimum of 2 rounds. The chance of success depends on <PRO_HISHER> Hide in Shadows skill, but this ability is separate from the standard thief hiding skill—it functions as a unique, innate power.
– May cast Shadowstep (Planeshift / Blink) once per day. A new use is gained every three levels thereafter.

SHADOWSTEP (Planeshift): Step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, moving faster, effectively resisting and dodging every attack, and becoming completely undetectable for the duration while time stands still for the rest. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> cannot damage others, be targeted by others, or cast spells, but <PRO_HESHE> may move at will during this time. Upon returning to the Prime, <PRO_HESHE> gains temporary bonuses to <PRO_HISHER> combat effectiveness, including the ability to backstab from any angle. These benefits scale with the shadowdancer's level.

SHADOWSTEP (Blink): An alternative to the planeshift version, the shadowdancer may choose to instantly teleport to a place within sight, which applies all the benefits of the planeshift version.

– May cast Shadow Illusion once per day, gaining one use at level 3, 12, and 20.

SHADOW ILLUSION: Conjure shadowy illusions to confuse enemies. Unless a save vs. Spell is made, it causes one of the following: fear, berserk, blindness, or confusion for 1 round. For the next four rounds, enemies have a chance to resist these effects each round, but may still fall prey to them. During the full 5 rounds, affected enemies also lose immunity to backstabs, if they had it, and suffer a 25% spell failure. The spell improves with level but has no effect on creatures with very high intelligence, or those that innately see through illusions. It is not subject to Magic Resistance or dispelling effects but True Sight can remove it or prevent its effects from taking hold.

– May cast Summon Shade once per day, gaining a single use at level 4.

SUMMON SHADE: Summon a shade from the Plane of Shadow for 8 hours. It is loyal to the caster, resistant to damage, and immune to turning and spells that banish summoned creatures. Its touch can temporarily drain Strength from its if a save vs. Death at +2 is failed. As the shadowdancer gains experience, the shade does as well, becoming more capablet, and evolving into greater shades.

– May cast Shadow Evade once per day, gaining one use at level 5, and then again at levels 10 and 15.

SHADOW EVADE: The shadowdancer conceals <PRO_HIMHER>self in shadowstuff, making <PRO_HIMHER> harder to hit. It provides a +4 bonus to Armor Class, a +2 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 15% damage resistance. During this time, <PRO_HESHE> is also under the effects of Invisibility. Each new use adds 1 round to its duration and 5% to its damage resistance.

– May cast Shadow Conjuration once per day starting at level 6, with additional uses gained at levels 9 and 12.

SHADOW CONJURATION: This skill allows the shadowdancer to draw various amounts of energy from the Demiplane of Shadow to conjure phantasmal version of one of the following spells: Darkness, Invisibility, Shield, Magic Missile, Sleep. The spells are always cast at half the shadowdancer's current level.

– Shadow Haven: At level 10, shadows embrace <PRO_HIMHER> while invisible, regenerating 1 Hit Point per round, while protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from detection by all means except True Sight.
– Greater Shadow Conjuration: At level 12, <PRO_HESHE> learns a more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Melf's Acid Arrow, Web, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Blindness. New uses are gained at levels 15 and 18.
– Shades: At level 18, <PRO_HESHE> learns an even more powerful version of Shadow Conjuration which grants access to the following spells: Cone of Cold, Shadow Fireball, Stoneskin, Shadow Door. New uses are gained at levels 21 and 24.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to any non-lawful
– Backstab multiplier uses the normal progression, but it only grows up to 4x
– May only distribute 15 skill points per level (40 at level 1) among thieving skills
– May not use the Set Snare ability or learn any high-level abilities that introduce traps

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma~

@1 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you've spent your childhood yearning for a life cloaked in shadows and secrecy. While other children played at knights and dragons, you danced unseen through the quiet halls of Candlekeep, imagining yourself a phantom among the blind and complacent. The ambling, preoccupied monks have often played the role of secret lords of Waterdeep in your mind, their purses tempting tests of your growing skill. Gorion, ever perceptive, has more than once asked you to discreetly return an inkwell or scroll to its rightful place, though rarely with more than a knowing glance. Though the deeper vaults of the keep remain beyond your reach, you've found little satisfaction in pilfering from your caretakers. Instead, your heart yearns for a grander stage—one where your steps vanish in silence and your talents can truly flourish in the dark.~

  // SHADOWDANCER SPELLS

@300 = ~Planeshift~
@301 = ~Blink~
@3 = ~Shadowstep~
@4 = ~Shadowstep
This spell can be cast in two ways: Planeshift or Blink. The shadowdancer chooses which version to use when casting.

Planeshift: Instantly step into the Shadow Plane for about 7 seconds, increasing movement speed by 22% (with each additional use further increasing speed by 11%). While in the Shadow Plane, the shadowdancer is completely undetectable, immune to all effects that allow a saving throw, and time stands still for others. During this period, <PRO_HESHE> cannot attack, be attacked, or cast spells, but can move freely for tactical positioning.

Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the shadowdancer gains the following benefits for roughly half a round:

– May backstab from any direction once
– Attacks cannot critically miss and ignore weapon speed factor delays
– Luck: +1
– THAC0: +1, increasing by +1 with each new use (up to +6)
– Damage: +1, increasing by +1 every other new use (up to +3)
– Critical hit chance: +5%, improving to +10% at level 13 and +15% at level 25

These benefits are consumed after the first successful attack (a hit that is not blocked by weapon immunities) following shadowstep. For the remainder of the effect's duration, the shadowdancer retains a +6 bonus to saving throws and Armor Class.

Blink: Alternatively, the shadowdancer may instantly teleport to any visible location. This version grants all the same benefits as Planeshift, which apply immediately after teleporting.~

@5 = ~Shadow Illusion~
@6 = ~Shadow Illusion
Conjure shadowy illusions that disorient an enemy. Unless a save vs. Spell is made, this ability causes one of the following effects: fear, berserk, blindness, or confusion for 1 round. For the next four rounds, the enemy has a chance to resist these effects each round, but may still succumb to them. During the full 5 rounds, the enemy has a 25% spell failure penalty, and it also loses immunity to sneak attacks and backstabs, if they had it. The spell improves at higher levels as follows:

– Save penalty improves by 1 at level 8, and every 6 levels thereafter, up to -4.
– At level 12, the spell affects nearby enemies, causing chaos among them.
– At level 14, the targets become more susceptible to damage, taking 10% more physical damage and suffering a -4 penalty to Armor Class.
– At level 17, blindness is always applied if the spell is successful, along with any other effects. This blindness cannot be resisted in subsequent rounds.

This spell has no effect on creatures with very high intelligence (18 or more), or those that can see through illusions, such as demons and dragons. It is not subject to Magic Resistance or dispelling effects although True Sight can remove it or prevent their effects from taking hold on such caster.~

@7 = ~Summon Shade~
@8 = ~Summon Shade
Summon an invisible, neutrally-aligned shade from the Plane of Shadow for 8 hours or until it is slain. This shadowy creature possesses all the immunities of an undead being, including immunity to turning, spells that destroy or banish summoned creatures, blindness, and illithid attacks. It is highly resistant to damage, regenerates slowly (faster when invisible), and can temporarily drain Strength from its victims with a touch if they fail a Save vs. Death at +2.

This loyal undead companion starts off less powerful than its regular counterparts but grows stronger as the shadowdancer gains experience. It evolves into more capable and resistant forms, gaining innate abilities and ultimately transforming into greater types of shades:

– Shadow from levels 4 to 11
– Greater Shadow from levels 12 to 19
– Shadowlord from levels 20 to 27
– Greater Shadowlord from levels 28 to 35
– Nighthaunt at level 36 and above

The creature's Hit Dice (HD) are always one less than the shadowdancer's, up to a maximum of 27 HD.~

@9 = ~Hide in plain sight~
@90 = ~Failed to hide in plain sight~
@10 = ~Hide in plain sight
Immediately hide, even in plain sight, for 20 seconds once per turn. The cooldown decreases by 1 round at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, reaching a minimum of 2 rounds at level 40.

The chances of success are directly tied to the Shadowdancer's Hiding in Shadows ability in the following way:

– 0-30: 50% chance of success
– 31-50: 65% chance of success
– 51-75: 80% chance of success
– 76-100: 90% chance of success
– 101-150: 95% chance of success
– 151-200: 99% chance of success
– 201+: 100% chance of success~

@10010 = ~Hide in plain sight is available for use.~

@11 = ~Shadow Form
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/10 levels starting at level 30
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: The caster

This ability is a more powerful version of Shadow Evade that temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-stuff, making the subject partially incorporeal and regenerating 1 HP per second. For its duration, gain a +4 Armor Class bonus, and all attacks directed against the shadowdancer deal 50% less of their normal damage. During this time, the user becomes invisible, receives a +4 bonus to all Saving Throws, and may not be detected by any divinations until they choose to partially reveal themselves by taking certain actions, or the effect runs out.

Requirements: Improved Shadow Evade~

@12 = ~Shadow Maze
This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 7 feet of the shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or become trapped inside that space between 5 to 14 rounds. This spell becomes increasingly difficult to resist as the shadowdancer becomes more experienced: at level 28, the penalty becomes -5, and at 36, -6.

After being released, living beings resurface feeling weakened for 1 turn, suffering the following non-stackable effects:

– Strength, Dexterity, Armor Class, THAC0, damage, saving throws, and casting speed: -2 penalty
– Movement speed reduced by 25%
– 5% increased chance to critically miss when attacking

These penalties cannot reduce Strength or Dexterity below 1.~

@13 = ~Artisan of Shadows~
@14 = ~Artisan of Shadows
Your mastery over the elusive power of shadows has now reached incredible heights. As a testament to your profound connection with it, you gain the following abilities:

– Immunity to blindness
– Backstabs no longer require you to be behind the target to be successful
– For two rounds after landing a critical hit, the target loses their immunity to backstabs, if they had it, and the shadowdancer gains a 5% bonus to critical hit chances and cannot critically miss (does not stack)

Requirements: Shadowdancer only~

@130 = ~Shadostrike~
@131 = ~Shadowstrike
The shadowdancer may choose to infuse their backstabs with a bit of shadow magic for 1 turn to achieve various effects:

– Beshadowed Strike: Backstabs have a 30% chance of making the shadowdancer immediately invisible for 2 rounds, and the target is blinded for 3 rounds unless a save vs. Spell at -4 is made.
– Shadowchill Strike: Backstabs deal extra 1d4 cold and 1d4 magic damage. If the target is blinded, they deal 2d4+1 cold and 2d4+1 magic damage.
– Enervating Strike: Backstabs halve the victim's Strength for 5 rounds if they fail a Save vs. Death (does not stack, and cannot reduce Strength below 1). Attacks will also deal maximum damage during the first round.

During this time, the critical hit chances are 5% higher. None of these effects are affected by Magic Resistance and they do not stack with each other. Each application replaces the other.~

@132 = ~Beshadowed Strike~
@133 = ~Shadowchill Strike~
@134 = ~Enervating Strike~

@15 = ~Self-Concealment~
